WalletVision is an Android application designed to assist visually impaired individuals in identifying Indian currency notes. The app leverages deep learning and computer vision to provide real-time currency detection using the device's camera.

## Features

- **Real-Time Currency Detection**: Uses the device's camera to detect and identify Indian currency notes.
- **High Accuracy**: A deep learning model trained on 1,000 images achieves an accuracy of **99.59%**.
- **Optimized for Mobile**: The model is converted and optimized using TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) for efficient on-device inference.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Flutter for a seamless and intuitive user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Dart (Flutter)
- **Backend**: TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, NumPy
- **Model Optimization**: TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)

## How It Works

1. **Model Training**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on a dataset of 1,000 images of Indian currency notes.
2. **Model Conversion**: The trained model is converted and optimized using TFLite for efficient on-device inference.
3. **Integration**: The optimized model is integrated into a Flutter application for real-time currency detection.
4. **Real-Time Detection**: Users can point their device's camera at a currency note, and the app will identify the note in real-time.
